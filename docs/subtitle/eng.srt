Nice easy mile now, warm it up!

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,471
- Take your time.
- Hurry up!

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,794
It'd be so much cuter
if you were wearing little shoes.

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,678
It'd be cuter if he exploded at the end.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,360
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,480
- You know...
- Black lung.

8
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,296
Did you know that
pilgrims used to think sneezing

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,879
meant you were
expelling demons?

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,635
- What?
- That's why I never sneeze.

11
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,240
I want to keep them all

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,800
- in my soul.
- Your soul.

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,111
If I had one.

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,236
<i>Twitter poll.</i>

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,391
If you could stay one age forever,
what would it be?

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,592
- Easy. 21.
- No way. I'd be 10.

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,319
No, 10 was the worst, man.

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,909
I say, 30. It's like
the height of sophistication.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,992
- You?
- What about the age we are right now?

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,296
I'd like to stay like this forever.

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,471
Seriously? I mean,
what's wrong with you?

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,836
Okay, fine.
The age we are right now,

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,718
but we could all live
in a house together.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Okay, fine.
But without Wren, though?

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,039
Yeah, obviously,
that goes without saying.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,839
Super funny. Like, whoa.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,119
Guys, the dudebros
in their natural habitat.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,709
Let's observe, shall we?

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,991
Hey, Tom!
So, what's the plan tonight?

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,596
- Big plans...
- Hey.

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,633
- It's top secret.
- I see. A circle jerk?

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,917
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Kyle.

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,151
So, what's the big secret?

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,433
I mean, I could tell you,
but then, I'd have to kill you.

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,670
- Okay, buddy.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,513
Yeah. It's very intriguing.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,958
You guys, I got to go get my sister,
but I love you. Bye.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,536
See you later. I'll pick you up tonight.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,200
- I'm sorry.
- Bye. It's okay.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,358
Bumped into Coach Sanders today.

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,276
Said your 1,600-meter time
is really improving.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,950
All that training's paying off.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,234
Nice work, sweetheart.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,757
Did you tell them Delores Constantino
quit the team?

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Why?

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,832
She's pregnant.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,114
What is she planning to do, now?

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,311
She's gonna drop out, and keep the baby.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,110
I assume
Wren is gonna be at Katie's tonight?

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,319
Yeah. So?

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
So, what are you guys gonna do?

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,636
You know, drink a lot of vodka,
and meet guys online.

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,110
Funny. Very funny.

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,956
- Can I come?
- Not a chance.

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,436
- You said I could come next time.
- I lied.

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,075
- Hey.
- Hey.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,400
Do you think
I could hang out with you guys?

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,077
Yeah, not tonight, grasshopper.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,919
Sorry. Maybe next time.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,878
I wore the shirt you gave me to school.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
Got sent to the principal's office.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,757
- Well done, man. Yes.
- Hey.

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,196
- Hey.
- Goodbye.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,555
Bye.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,597
Love me.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,756
Bye, Lizzie.

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,950
- Hey.
- Hey.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,875
Don't make any noise. It's dormant.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,992
Just another exciting Friday
night at the Jensens.

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,436
<i>No?</i>

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah, it's girl gaze porn.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,954
You know how they have POV porn?

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,793
- Yeah.
- This one's from our perspective.

74
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
- I don't want to see that.
- For sure.

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Oh, my God.

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,360
Do you think she likes that?

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
- Oh, my God!
- No!

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,317
Oh, God! Once you see it,
you just can't unsee it.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,240
What the hell is he doing?

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,479
He's probably just
looking for another bottle.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,637
- Sometimes, I wish I could just leave.
- I know.

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,350
Why don't we just all leave?
Get out of this stupid town together.

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,037
Where would we go?

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,836
I have friends in Paris.
We could totally stay with them.

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,798
What friends?
You've never been to Paris.

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,189
- My mom has friends there, idiot.
- Don't I wish.

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll just be stuck here forever,
in this shithole.

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,189
Seriously! No, I think you and Carl
would make an adorable couple.

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,155
It's "Kyle," and I don't like him.

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,591
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever, you know.

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,672
But we all know that you wish you were

92
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,434
at their little
secret sausage fest right now.

93
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,193
No.

94
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,074
But I do know what their secret is.

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,159
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,471
So, they're getting together
tonight at Tom's house

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,553
in his garage, to summon Slender Man.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,953
- Creepy.
- Who's Slender Man?

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,874
Yeah, he's the guy
who makes all those kids disappear.

100
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
Why have I not heard of this?

101
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,352
That's a much longer conversation.

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,270
- Listen.
- Troll...

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,398
"Slender Man can manifest
in a variety of forms.

104
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,869
"Certain accounts speak
of a hypnotic power

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,839
"that renders his victims helpless
to stop themselves

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,353
"from walking into waiting arms.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,597
"While his origins and motives
are completely unknown,

108
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,594
"he preys upon innocent youth.

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,717
"Once you see him, you're his.

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,836
"Some he takes, some he doesn't.

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,478
"Nobody knows why he takes who he takes,
or why he leaves who he leaves.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,953
"But the ones he leaves behind
are messed up forever."

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,237
All right, here it is.
"How to summon Slender Man."

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,711
- Guys, we so have to do this.
- We actually don't.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Actually.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,632
If they're doing it, we're doing it.

117
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,720
This feels wrong. This feels like

118
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,430
Russian malware-y virus-type shit.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,159
Come on, don't be such a wuss.

120
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,032
"Those who hear the three bells toll

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,998
"accept his invitation.

122
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,154
"When you hear the first,
you must close your eyes,

123
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,078
"keeping words unspoken.

124
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,398
"If one wants to hear,
you must listen closely,

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,319
"for they are soft and distant.

126
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,476
"With eyes still closed
and mind wide open,

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,640
"clear your thoughts
and await the second,

128
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,954
"opening your eyes
only once you've heard the third."

129
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,433
Are you serious? This is...

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,272
What a stupid video. Honestly.

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,190
Can we do something else?

132
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,391
- Let's watch a movie.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,470
This burial ground dates back
all the way to the Revolutionary War,

134
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,951
which was 1775 to 1783.

135
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,797
In 2004, it was put on the
National Registry of Historical Sites,

136
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,156
which was very exciting.

137
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,632
Initially, all of this land
belonged to Thomas Clifton,

138
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,994
who left it to the town of Winsford
in his will in 1674.

139
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,598
You guys, I threw up twice
this morning before I got on the bus.

140
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Is it Carl's?

141
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,635
That's hilarious,
and also, scientifically impossible.

142
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,594
Have you been having nightmares?

143
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,309
Have you?

144
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
About what?

145
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,831
It's nothing, really.
It's just that video.

146
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,517
...stronger and more durable,
which is also...

147
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,630
Hey, Katie?

148
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,076
Katie, are you okay?

149
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,038
Yes.

150
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,397
Katie? Cut this shit out, man.

151
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,949
All right, we're all prisoners
because of you.

152
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,799
So, none of you saw where she went?

153
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,639
- No.
- Really?

154
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,636
- Damn it.
- I mean, where is she?

155
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,872
Yeah, she still hasn't answered
any of my texts.

156
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,354
Why are the police here?

157
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,072
Oh, shit.

158
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,075
You see her?

159
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,350
<i>Teenager Katie Jensen was last seen
on Wednesday, during a school field trip</i>

160
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,716
<i>to the historic Clifton Cemetery.</i>

161
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,797
<i>As of now, local police have no leads,</i>

162
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,196
<i>but are questioning friends
and family members</i>

163
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,671
<i>in hopes of gaining insight
into the reason for her disappearance.</i>

164
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,039
<i>Citizens with any information are being
urged to contact local authorities.</i>

165
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,072
You should tell me
what really happened to Katie.

166
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,355
We never keep secrets from each other.

167
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,638
How would you know?
You don't know that. Do your homework.

168
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,280
Come on, I don't want to talk about it.

169
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,191
It was a boy, right?
You think I'll tell? I'd never tell.

170
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,469
You'd totally tell.

171
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Not Mom and Dad.

172
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,554
Totally Mom and Dad.

173
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,196
Maybe.

174
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,191
Definitely, but
you get points for honesty.

175
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,318
So, tell me.

176
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,760
You don't know. Do you?

177
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,233
Just do your work, Lizzie.

178
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
- Hallie.
- Lizzie.

179
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,155
Fine.

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,391
I could stay home alone, you know.
I'm old enough.

181
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,437
Physical age, maybe.

182
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Did you hear that?

183
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,310
Hey, Mom? Dad!

184
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,960
Hey, Mom?

185
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,953
- Hallie, someone's in here.
- Stay here. Okay? Don't move.

186
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,274
Hallie? Hallie, what is it? Hallie...

187
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,520
We called the police!

188
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,311
Katie? Katie?

189
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,358
<i>Police emergency. Can I help you?</i>

190
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,352
Katie.

191
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,397
Katie, you here?

192
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,678
Mr. Jensen?

193
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,439
Where's my daughter?

194
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,755
I don't know.

195
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,116
- Is Katie here? Are you hiding her?
- No.

196
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,390
I don't know where she is.

197
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,677
It's all your fault.

198
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,713
She was never into this stuff.

199
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,190
- All this occult stuff.
- Hallie?

200
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,516
Lizzie, stay back.

201
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,192
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

202
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,712
- Where is she?
- No! Don't! Hallie!

203
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,160
- Where is my daughter?
- Hallie!

204
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
- Lizzie!
- Where is she?

205
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,910
Let's go.

206
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,336
- Stay the hell away from my family!
- Hey, hey, hey!

207
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,477
You hear me, Jensen?

208
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,040
Did you guys really try
and summon Slender Man?

209
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Why?

210
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,275
- We chickened out.
- You chickened out.

211
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,496
- I chickened out?
- You chickened out.

212
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,776
- I remember you being the one...
- He chickened out.

213
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
...that chickened out.

214
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,636
Katie's father
broke into my house last night.

215
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,718
- What?
- What?

216
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,511
He said something about Katie
being into the occult,

217
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,136
and then he blamed us
for getting her into it.

218
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,816
Wait, what did he mean about
Katie being into the occult?

219
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,399
I don't know. He was so wasted.

220
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,838
This could be
the next wrinkle in the story.

221
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,195
I don't want to play this game.

222
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,800
It's not a game. Katie's missing.

223
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,991
Yeah, and we know things
that nobody else knows.

224
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,594
What do we know?

225
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,280
We know that she watched that video.

226
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,117
Look, we all watched that video.
It didn't do anything.

227
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,160
When are we gonna admit
that Katie was kidnapped?

228
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
Somebody has her.

229
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,510
Yeah, but when we watched that video,
it affected all of us.

230
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,193
Something happened. I felt it.

231
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,640
- I didn't see anything.
- I didn't see anything, either.

232
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,750
Didn't say I saw it. I said I felt it.

233
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,956
And I think you did, too.

234
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,872
And I'm damn sure that Katie felt it,

235
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,232
and that's why she disappeared!

236
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,356
This is a bad idea.

237
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,875
It's just a quick look around, okay?

238
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,830
Plus, you know what,
he's probably totally passed out by now.

239
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,816
I don't know, I just feel like
there's got to be something.

240
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,576
- You know, like a clue, maybe, or...
- You're crazy.

241
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,435
You don't realize how he was last night.

242
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,713
The back door is always unlocked
for when Katie gets home late.

243
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,438
Just saying.

244
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,719
Great. Then let's go.

245
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,359
Told ya.

246
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Wren?

247
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,917
Hi. Hi, Mr. Jensen.

248
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,112
What are you doing here?

249
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,749
Well, I just wanted to come down

250
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,675
and see if there was anything
that I could do, if I could help

251
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,000
in any way?

252
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,198
Anything I could do.

253
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,273
I miss her.

254
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,391
People just don't disappear.

255
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,040
You want to come in?

256
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,357
That'd be great.

257
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,470
She's really gone.

258
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,316
The police must have taken her laptop.

259
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,992
What is all this?

260
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,510
She used to keep
cigarettes and stuff in here.

261
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,870
Let's just take it.

262
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,040
Okay. Here's the last site she visited.

263
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,879
What am I looking at?

264
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Here, click it.

265
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay.

266
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,994
Oh, shit.

267
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,235
All these, like, town names,
and dates and stuff.

268
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Click another one.

269
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,239
<i>Okay, guys. Let's go.</i>

270
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,796
<i>I am Slender Man.</i>

271
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,879
<i>- Dude.
- Guys, guys.</i>

272
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,315
<i>What is that? What is that?</i>

273
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
<i>I'm so scared. I'm so...</i>

274
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,756
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

275
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,760
<i>- Oh, God!
- Dude, he's there!</i>

276
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,910
<i>I can't...</i>

277
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,714
- It's him.
- I don't like this.

278
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,191
- Wait, look.
- What?

279
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,399
AleeyKat93.

280
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,956
Geez.

281
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,034
They went back and forth,
like, a gazillion times.

282
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,749
"I knew he was there
before I saw him."

283
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,590
It's like they're comparing experiences.

284
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,800
Wait, look. Katie posted a video.

285
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,594
Look, it's from the
night before she disappeared.

286
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,756
- What was that?
- What did you see?

287
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,675
What did you see?

288
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,800
- I don't know, I...
- I don't know, either.

289
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,993
- I talked to her.
- Who?

290
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,595
AleeyKat93.

291
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,976
It was that girl that Katie was
talking to on that website.

292
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,674
I messaged her, and she replied.

293
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,035
You went back on that website?

294
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,478
She told me everything.
He gets in your head like a virus.

295
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
What kind of virus?

296
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,791
Like a computer virus
that infects your hard drive,

297
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,536
but instead of your hard drive,
it's your brain.

298
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,496
- Wren, you're gonna need to slow down...
- No, listen to me.

299
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,434
Once the virus takes hold,
he's got you. It's done.

300
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,075
Some he haunts, some he drives mad.

301
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,551
- And others, he takes, like...
- Like what?

302
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,153
Katie.

303
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,119
Listen, I know that this...

304
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,476
This is gonna sound crazy,

305
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,753
but AleeyKat said we can

306
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,719
"unveil ourselves."

307
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,519
Okay, if we just surrender
something to him

308
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,718
that has personal meaning,
something that we truly love.

309
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,960
What the hell does that mean?

310
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,990
We can contact Slender Man.

311
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,358
Why would we do that?

312
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,916
To get Katie back. Hello?

313
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,269
Katie did it, and the next day,
she was just gone.

314
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,511
Okay, Katie asked Slender Man

315
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,319
- to take her?
- Yes.

316
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,438
Why would she do that?

317
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,549
I don't know. You know,
maybe she had an alcoholic father,

318
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,519
and maybe she hated her life,
and maybe she talked about

319
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,479
running away all the time, you know?

320
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,754
Guys, the police have no leads.

321
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,674
Right? Right?

322
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,040
So, even if the odds
are a million-to-one

323
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,720
that any of this is real, or that...

324
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,839
That he has anything to do
with Katie's disappearance,

325
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,360
we owe it to her to try.

326
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,837
This should work.

327
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,112
I guess that I'll...

328
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,270
Go first, then.

329
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,960
I made this in pottery class,
when I was five.

330
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,313
This is a picture of me and my dad.

331
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,236
It's the only one I have
where we're together.

332
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,154
It was taken a few months
before he died.

333
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,239
My grandma made this
when Lizzie was born.

334
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,316
She died eight years ago.

335
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,633
Surprised you didn't bring
one of your trophies, or medals.

336
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,914
You said it had to be something
I cared about, so...

337
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,990
I brought this.

338
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,795
Lights out.

339
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,511
Okay, so...

340
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,794
Listen, once we ask for Katie's return,

341
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,072
we have to keep
these blindfolds on, all right?

342
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,234
AleeyKat said not to look in his face.

343
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,678
If you do, you're messed up forever.

344
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,471
It's different for everyone,
but it only ends in insanity, or death.

345
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,877
Okay.

346
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,236
Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand.
You hold her hand, too, okay?

347
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,199
We all have to hold hands.

348
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,672
How long do you think
we're gonna give this?

349
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,037
As long as it takes.

350
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,353
Keep your blindfolds on.

351
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,072
Do you hear that?

352
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,400
Guys, we shouldn't be doing this.

353
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,677
- She's right.
- It's too late.

354
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,040
- Chloe! Chloe!
- Chloe, come back!

355
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,759
- Come on! Chloe!
- Come back, Chloe!

356
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,712
Chloe?

357
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,590
Hallie!

358
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,599
Oh, my God! Hallie.

359
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,000
- Where's Chloe?
- I don't know!

360
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,311
I told her to keep
her freaking blindfold on.

361
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,517
- She...
- Chloe!

362
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,358
- Oh, my God, Chloe!
- Chloe!

363
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,518
Jesus, Chloe, you scared us to death!
Where did you go?

364
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,680
I lost my shoe.

365
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
It's okay.

366
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
What happened?

367
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,271
- You saw him.
- Wren.

368
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,676
Chloe, I told you
not to take your blindfold off.

369
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,992
- Did you see him?
- Nothing happened.

370
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,437
I just got scared. Okay?

371
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,991
Something happened, and she knows it.
Something happened back there!

372
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,677
You're right. We didn't get Katie back.
That's what happened.

373
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,752
Come on.

374
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,554
Wait, guys. Wait for me.

375
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,432
Hal?

376
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,193
Go away.

377
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,959
Are you okay?

378
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,236
I'm fine!

379
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,990
I'm fine! Just...
I'll see you later, okay?

380
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,034
Just go to sleep.
We'll hang tomorrow, okay?

381
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,875
Hey.

382
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,710
What's up with Chloe?
It's been a few days.

383
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,070
She's fine. Just a cold.

384
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,718
Hey, Hallie! Wait up.

385
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,990
- Hey.
- Hey.

386
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,637
How you holding up?
I mean, with Katie and everything.

387
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,075
Well, I'm okay. I...

388
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,880
Hey, tomorrow's Friday.

389
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,037
We got the weekend coming up.

390
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,995
I was thinking,
maybe we should do something.

391
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,310
Yeah, sure.

392
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,949
You want to come over tomorrow night?
To my place?

393
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,193
Hallie.

394
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,753
Hallie?

395
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,672
- What?
- Are you okay?

396
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,195
Yeah, that's cool. Your place?

397
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,479
Sure.

398
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,675
I'll see you later?

399
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,517
Okay.

400
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,832
Hallie. Hallie, can you...
Can you hear me? I...

401
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,392
Hello?

402
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,439
Oh, God.

403
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,470
Please! Please help!

404
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,116
No! No, no!

405
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,075
No!

406
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,197
Please!

407
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,432
No, no!

408
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,396
Miss, are you all right?

409
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,033
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

410
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,477
I'm sorry.

411
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,394
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

412
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,117
Hey. Are you not
getting my texts, or something?

413
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,416
- Look, Wren, I don't...
- No, no, no.

414
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,592
Look at me. I found proof.
I found the proof. Right?

415
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,816
Look, look, look, I understand.

416
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,936
I understand now,
what AleeyKat was trying to tell me.

417
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,077
It's proof. Read this.
Read this with me.

418
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,550
Okay, it says, "paranormal contact
with bioelectric systems

419
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,959
"often results
in a symbiotic relationship.

420
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,232
"The effects on host organisms
have been well documented and manifest

421
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,636
"in various forms, such as..."

422
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,677
- Wren. Wren. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

423
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,117
Listen to me. "Personality
change, bizarre behavior,

424
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,989
"mental illness, psychosis,
loss of contact with reality,

425
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,551
"self-mutilation, and suicide.

426
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,799
"And nonspecific dissolution."

427
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,031
They just disappear.

428
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,471
Has...

429
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,999
Has anything weird happened
to you lately, or strange, or...

430
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,594
Do not hold out on me.

431
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,710
- Okay, so, I was talking with Tom...
- Tom?

432
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,396
- What's wrong with Tom?
- What? Who gives a shit about Tom, Hal?

433
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,816
- Just tell me what happened.
- Okay.

434
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,958
I thought I saw something in the trees.

435
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,713
It was him.

436
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,349
And, what about Chloe?
Have you talked to her?

437
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,712
I don't know. I've called her house,
and her mom keeps telling me she's sick.

438
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,960
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat out told me to stay away.

439
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,396
We need to go there right now.

440
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,256
Wren, there's nothing we can do,
and I have track.

441
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,715
- I can't just leave.
- Track?

442
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,875
I thought you didn't care
about track anymore.

443
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,714
I thought you cared about Chloe.

444
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,596
Chloe.

445
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,990
Chloe. Wake up.

446
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,752
What the hell was that?

447
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,160
I don't know, but I told...

448
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,476
I knew that she saw his face
in the woods, you know?

449
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,791
I knew that she was lying, too.
I knew that.

450
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,157
I don't want to do this anymore.

451
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,995
Yeah, I don't, either.

452
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,312
But I'm stuck in it.

453
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,600
And you are, too.
You just don't realize it yet.

454
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,120
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing a "thing."

455
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,550
All right.

456
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,080
"All right"?
Yeah, don't say "All right."

457
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,751
We only watched the website video.

458
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,112
But Chloe, she saw him in the woods.

459
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,637
- Wren, I can't keep...
- Read the book that I showed you.

460
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,352
You will see the body count, okay?
Thousands of disappearances.

461
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,520
Search parties, faces on milk cartons.
I'm not making this shit up.

462
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,070
And it all happened
exactly like AleeyKat said.

463
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,576
It's probably some 50-year-old dude
living in his parents' basement,

464
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,990
getting off on e-mailing
teenage girls every day.

465
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,197
Did you ever think of that? Did you?

466
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,314
So, you think that you can
just go back to real life?

467
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,319
Yeah, I do.
In fact, I have a real-life date

468
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,792
with real-life Tom tonight.
In real life.

469
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,991
He's not gonna stop!

470
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,640
And going on a date
with fucking Abercrombie Tom

471
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,359
is not gonna change anything!

472
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,160
You know I'm right!

473
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,151
You know I'm right.

474
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,355
- Hey.
- Hey.

475
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
Sorry I'm late.

476
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,876
- No worries. Come on in.
- Thanks.

477
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,354
I thought I had the wrong house

478
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,194
because there weren't any cars
in the driveway.

479
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,599
Yeah, my dad's at this business thing,
and Mom's at her book club, so...

480
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,873
So, nobody's home?

481
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,073
No, it's just us. Is that okay?

482
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,555
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

483
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,916
I didn't know you were
such a music geek.

484
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,355
So, this is my dad's, but I like it.

485
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,470
Cool.

486
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,632
Do you want me to put
something else on, or...

487
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,080
- No. This is great.
- Okay. Cool.

488
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,634
- What?
- Do you hear that?

489
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,071
Yeah. It's good, right?

490
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
Hey.

491
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,352
Hey, come here.

492
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,796
What the hell?

493
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,319
Hallie, I didn't do anything.

494
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,478
I know. Oh, God.

495
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,473
Are you okay?

496
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,632
Here.

497
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,276
Have you told anyone else about this?

498
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,877
If Katie was on some weird
Slender Man website, then,

499
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,114
who knows who she met? I mean...

500
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,590
Probably some weird guy
in a van, you know?

501
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,995
I hate to say it.

502
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,553
Is this it?

503
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,757
- No, don't.
- Come on.

504
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,674
Tom, please. You can't go on that site.

505
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,635
- It's just a video.
- It's not just a video.

506
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,473
Promise me
you won't ever watch that video.

507
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,075
Tom, I'm serious. Please promise.

508
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,637
Okay. Okay, I promise.

509
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,432
Really.

510
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,718
I need to go.

511
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,790
All right, first,
let's all take a moment to observe...

512
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,794
- Tom. Hey.
- ...the exterior anatomy here.

513
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,873
Tom? Tom.

514
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,952
Hey. Are you okay?

515
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,154
Now, you'll notice that the cornea
looks a little cloudy and bluish.

516
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,837
That happens naturally because
of the preservation process.

517
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,792
So, very carefully, with your scalpels,

518
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,231
I want you to make a slice right through
the sclera as evenly as you can.

519
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,599
That's gonna separate
the anterior features of the eye.

520
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,038
Hallie.

521
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,552
- Katie?
- Hallie.

522
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,479
Hallie.

523
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,913
Katie?

524
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
Hallie!

525
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,990
- Help me, Hallie.
- Katie?

526
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,398
Katie?

527
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,440
Hallie.

528
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,480
Katie!

529
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,713
Katie, come back!

530
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,153
Katie!

531
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,914
Katie!

532
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,234
Katie!

533
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,639
Katie!

534
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,315
Katie!

535
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,029
Hallie, help me.

536
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,592
- Come on, breathe.
- You're gonna be okay.

537
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,592
- Breathe...
- How long did they say?

538
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,990
- I don't know. Come on. Come on.
- It's gonna be okay.

539
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,077
- Just breathe, sweetheart.
- Breathe, breathe.

540
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,231
Come on. We got you.
We got you. Stay up.

541
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,118
That's right, deep breath.

542
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,736
- Just breathe. Deep breaths.
- Lizzie, what's going on?

543
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,353
Oh, my God. Lizzie!

544
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,816
- The ambulance is on its way.
- Lizzie.

545
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,240
Lizzie, it's okay. Just look at me.

546
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,074
- We got you.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.

547
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,755
Okay, the ambulance
is on its way, honey.

548
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,399
No. No, Lizzie!

549
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,597
- Lizzie, wake up! Lizzie!
- We're all here, Lizzie.

550
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,256
- Dad, do something!
- Where is that ambulance?

551
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,376
- I'm doing my best. Come on, Lizzie!
- Lizzie, wake up!

552
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,869
- Come on, Lizzie, just breathe.
- Lizzie, wake up!

553
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,669
Blood tests are negative.
She's gonna be fine.

554
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,714
They think it was just
some kind of panic attack.

555
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,954
They want to keep her to monitor her
for at least another day.

556
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,191
No. No.

557
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,717
Lizzie? Lizzie?

558
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,998
Lizzie! Lizzie!

559
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,271
Lizzie!

560
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,555
Lizzie, please.

561
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,950
Lizzie?

562
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,920
<i>Hallie?</i>

563
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,754
<i>Hallie?</i>

564
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,510
Hallie, are you okay?

565
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,035
- What's the matter?
- Sweetheart, what's going on?

566
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,478
Hey. She's okay. She's okay.

567
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,632
It's all right. She's gonna be fine.

568
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,192
<i>Dr. Barnes, 4721. Dr. Barnes, 4721.</i>

569
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,957
- BP 80/40.
- Let's get her moving.

570
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,713
- Lizzie!
- Get her moving.

571
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,314
- Lizzie!
- Let's get her moving.

572
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,936
- Where are they taking her?
- I've got to get her to the ICU.

573
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,679
- Lizzie!
- He had no face.

574
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,233
He had no face! He had no face!

575
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,640
He had no face!

576
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,998
Lizzie!

577
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,475
<i>Okay. So, now, what do I do?</i>

578
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,517
<i>Just sacrifice something you love.</i>

579
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,074
Wren!

580
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,229
Damn it, Wren! I know you're in there!

581
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,037
Open up!

582
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,518
Wren!

583
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,239
Wren!

584
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,400
Wren!

585
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,829
Wren, what are you doing?

586
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,517
Wren, take my hand. Come on.

587
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,352
Wren, you're gonna fall! Wren.

588
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,470
Wren!

589
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,680
I'm sorry.

590
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,118
You're sorry? That's it?
That's my sister! Why would you do that?

591
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,712
She came to me.

592
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,156
- Wren, she's in the hospital!
- She came to me.

593
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,160
It was before I knew.

594
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,439
To get Lizzie back, to make him stop,

595
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,351
you can't just
give him something you love.

596
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,033
It's not enough.

597
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,274
He wants us!

598
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,034
He wants us!

599
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,880
Hello?

600
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,596
No.

601
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,637
That's here. That's here.

602
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,758
Wait, wait, Hallie!

603
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,080
No.

604
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,076
Wren! Wren!

605
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,960
<i>To get Lizzie back...</i>

606
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,956
He had no face!

607
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,954
<i>...to make him stop...</i>

608
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,999
Hallie, are you okay?

609
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,637
<i>...you can'tjust give him
something you love.</i>

610
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,195
<i>He wants us!</i>

611
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,479
<i>He wants us!</i>

612
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,110
Take me.

613
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,471
<i>Lizzie!</i>

614
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,436
Hallie! No!

615
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,399
Hallie! Hallie! No!

616
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,836
- Honey! It's okay!
- Hallie! No! No!

617
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,920
It's okay.

618
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,720
- Nurse! Somebody help us!
- Hallie! Hallie!

619
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,837
- Hallie!
- Can we get a nurse in here?

620
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,639
No! No! No!

621
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,916
Right here.

622
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,798
<i>Hallie! No!</i>

623
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,154
<i>Hallie, Katie, Chloe, Wren.</i>

624
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,034
<i>There's almost always a pattern.</i>

625
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,074
<i>He only shows himself
just enough to infect us.</i>

626
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:06,712
<i>The more fear he creates,
the more fascinated we get.</i>

627
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,077
<i>We talk and write about him,
share pictures, click on links,</i>

628
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,597
<i>Photoshop images.
That's how a virus works.</i>

629
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,440
<i>That's how it spreads.</i>

630
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,520
<i>And some people cross the line
and actually seek him out,</i>

631
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,798
<i>like my sister and her friends did.</i>

632
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,237
<i>And those messed-up people
go out and do messed-up things</i>

633
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,791
<i>that become more stories
for people to tell.</i>

634
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,357
<i>It's all spreading his word. You know?</i>

635
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,318
<i>We know he abducts people.</i>

636
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,436
<i>I started getting a ringing in my ears.</i>

637
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,195
<i>It's the thing that we fear.</i>

638
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,440
<i>There'd been reports of strange lights
coming from the woods.</i>

639
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,556
<i>Viral nature of his ever-expanding reach
and influence.</i>

640
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,910
I keep having nightmares
about his pale face.

641
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,277
<i>Pictures include variations
of a thin man with a blanked-out face.</i>

642
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,120
<i>He seduces them.</i>
